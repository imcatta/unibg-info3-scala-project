# Info3 - Scala project
My Scala project for the [`Informatica 3 - parte A`](https://cs.unibg.it/gargantini/didattica/info3/) course [@UniBG](https://www.unibg.it/).

> This code does not make any sense as a real world application. 
> The purpose of this work is simply to show the scala features seen during the course.
